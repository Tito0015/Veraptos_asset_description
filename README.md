# Veraptos – Autonomous Incident Response for Web3/DeFi

This repository contains the technical asset and architecture diagram for “Veraptos,” an agentic security incident response automation platform, tailored for blockchain, DeFi, and hybrid cloud environments.

**Contents:**
- `Veraptos_asset_Tarek_Mhiri.pdf` — Solution one-pager (Chainlink-specific)
- `Veraptos_architecture.png` — IR pipeline diagram (Web3/DeFi, agentic automation)

These materials are submitted as part of my Chainlink Labs Security Response Engineer application. They demonstrate my approach to modern IR, detection engineering, and automation in decentralized environments.
